## CSS-features
### transition
Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like :hover or :active or dynamically set using JavaScript.

### @media()
The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.

### :nth-of-type()
The :nth-of-type() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position among siblings of the same type (tag name).

## javascript features
### const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel')
The Document method querySelectorAll() returns a static (not live) NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors.

### panel.addEventListener('click')
The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

### panel.classList
Returns a DOMTokenList representing the contents of the element's class attribute. If the class attribute is not set or empty, it returns an empty DOMTokenList, i.e. a DOMTokenList with the length property equal to 0.

Although the classList property itself is read-only, you can modify its associated DOMTokenList using the add(), remove(), replace(), and toggle() methods.
